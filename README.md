# Stock Valuation & Analysis: 
# Stock-prediction & Top stocks:
### These projects are written and presented as Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3), and each link is followed by a short description of project goals, contributions, and dependencies used. This repository contains my detailed analysis of investment and finance-related data science projects.

# Projects
## Stock price Prediction for Top American Stocks-

1. Performs complete comparisons of competitive strategy, financial strength, growth potential, and valuation of two companies through fundamental and technical analysis.
2. Wrote data parser and reader to download 10-Q and 10-K SEC filings and store them in pandas DataFrame, as well as scripts to append certain business performance metrics for trend analysis.
3. Designed risk-analysis models using Monte-Carlo Simulations and implemented visualizations using matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Combined data with experts' opinions and shareholder sentiment on business strategy and comapny/management direction to make final "best buy" decision.

## Risk/Return Analysis and Predictions for Stocks

1. Here I used pandas Dataframe to represent adjusted closing prices and compute moving averages, daily returns, and associated risk of 'FAANG' tech companies.
2. Created visual representations of comparative daily returns and single-stock analysis using Matplotlib, as well as more complex heatmaps and distribution plots using Seaborn.
3. Compared and plotted risk of investment between simple return analysis techniques and Monte-Carlo simulations.

# For Excel problem:- 
 1. Pulling stock data from Google Finance
 2. Pulling financial data from Yahoo Finance
 3. Calculating valuation multipliers
 4. Averaging multipliers and calculating difference
 5. Calculating fair price of a stock(TESLA)


# For Python Analysis:-

 1. What was the change in price of the stock over time?
 2. What was the daily return of the stock on average?
 3. What was the moving average of the various stocks?
 4. What was the correlation between different stocks'?
 5. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
 6. How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing price stock price of APPLE inc using LSTM)
